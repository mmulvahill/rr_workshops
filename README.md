# [CCTSI-BERD](http://www.ucdenver.edu/research/CCTSI/programs-services/berd/Pages/default.aspx) Workshop Series on Reproducible Research 

Two workshops currently planned:

1. Version Control with git
2. Reproducible Reporting with knitr


## Next steps

1. Create handouts 
1. Start ioslides documents
 

**Initial notes for the version control workshop**
- Teach using a GUI
- First half on local git; second on git remotes
- Attendees should leave with working git, GUI, GitHub account via example repository
- Mention git via CLI
- Mention git via Rstudio
- Git: 'lab notebok for the digital world' (via software-carpentry.org)

**Initial notes for reporting workshop**
- Stick to rmarkdown? 
- Focus on Word, PDF, html  --- do via bookdown?? or just rmarkdown??
- Include equations via mathjax
- Mention LaTeX, latex via Rnw, slides via ioslides, websites, books 
- Include SAS from within knitr and R (figure out how this works on Windows, from w/in Rstudio?)
- Mention Jupyter (include Jupyter??)




Needed info for webpage/announcement:
 
Please send me the following information:
- Brief introductory paragraph for top of page
- Maybe a brief description for each of your workshops
- Look at the registration form and let me know if you want to change or add any fields to your form
- Let me know who the intended audience is (students, faculty, staff, etc.) and if this should go out to all Anschutz schools and CCTSI


### Biostatistics Reproducible Research Workshop Series 2017

As research increases in complexity so too does the task of documenting the details and decisions made during data cleaning, analysis, and manuscript development. Reproducibility is the idea that each of these details and decisions is documented with computer code in such a way that another researcher could recreate and verify a study's results. 

In this workshop series, we will discuss the principles of reproducible research, with a focus on practical skills and tools for improving reproducibility.  Workshops will consist of both a presentation and a hands-on example.  Attendees should bring a laptop.


**Workshop 1: Reproducible Reporting and Literate Programming**

Reproducible reports integrate data analysis code into the document itself, with each number or statistic tied to the code used to create it. In this workshop we will discuss tools for creating reproducible documents, with a specific focus on R Markdown and knitr.  

**Workshop 2: Version Control**

'Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world' (Software Carpentry). In this workshop we will discuss the role of version control in research, with a specific focus on Git.

### Biostatistics Reproducible Research Workshop Series 2017

As research increases in complexity so too does the task of documenting the
details and decisions made during data cleaning, analysis, and manuscript
development. Reproducibility is the idea that each of these details and
decisions is documented with computer code in such a way that another researcher
could recreate and verify a study's results. 

In this workshop series, we will discuss the principles of reproducible
research, with a focus on practical skills and tools for improving
reproducibility.  Workshops will consist of both a presentation and a hands-on
example.  Attendees should bring a laptop.


**Workshop 1: Reproducible Reporting and Literate Programming**

Reproducible reports integrate data analysis code into the document itself, with
each number or statistic tied to the code used to create it. In this workshop we
will discuss tools for creating reproducible documents, with a specific focus on
R Markdown and knitr.  

**Workshop 2: Version Control**

'Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world' (Software Carpentry).
In this workshop we will discuss the role of version control in research, with a
specific focus on Git.

@techreport{Broman2017,
abstract = {The ASA asked these many of its members what advice they would provide to funding agencies to encourage reproducible research. The ASA shares their comments to inform discussions within funding agencies and more broadly. Our motivation is to help produce better scientific research and to highlight the role of statistics and statisticians. We do not intend these steps to be official recommendations that must be implemented but hope they are received as constructive contributions to the ongoing discussions. Definitions: We recognize the variation in definitions of terms regarding reproducible research. In this document, we adopt the following widely used definitions. 1 1. Reproducibility: A study is reproducible if you can take the original data and the computer code used to analyze the data and reproduce all of the numerical findings from the study. This may initially sound like a trivial task but experience has shown that it's not always easy to achieve this seemingly minimal standard. 2. Replicability: This is the act of repeating an entire study, independently of the original investigator without the use of original data (but generally using the same methods).},

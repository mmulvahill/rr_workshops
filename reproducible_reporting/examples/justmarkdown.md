This is an Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax (markup
language) originally for authoring HTML documents.  Through the document
conversion tool Pandoc, we can use it to create Word and PDF documents as well.

We can make lists

- Here
- is a
- bulleted list

and

1. here is
2. an enumerated
3. list

We can *italicize*, **bold**, ~~strikethrough~~, and _underline_ text.

There is `inline(code, formatting)` and 

```
# code blocks
summary(mtcars)
```

both of which are unevaluated.


> Quote blocks are also available.

And $\LaTeX$ equations $\sum_{i=1}^n x^2$

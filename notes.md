TITLE: Introduction to Git and Version Control in the Statistical Workflow

ABSTRACT: 
  “The lab notebook of the digital world” (Software Carpentry).  Version
  control is a system for documenting and tracking changes to files. The
  version control system git has become ubiquitous in software development and
  is increasingly seen as a key tool in conducting reproducible statistical
  research.  In this talk we introduce the basics of using git through the
  command line and a GUI (Rstudio or GitKraken), the difference between a git
  repository and a remote (such as GitHub), and implementation issues specific
  to statistical analyses. 

Key git Commands:
- git init
- git add
- git commit
- git status
- git log
- git push 
- git pull
